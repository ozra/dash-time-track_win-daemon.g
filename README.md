This is the AUTOMATIC TIME TRACKING TOOL â€” by checking currently active window each second and determine the title and the app-name, and derive from that.

TODO:

- see if `x11` can suffice to do the spying AND add spying on keypresses to determine user activity.

- NOOOO! NO MICRO-OPTS! ~~consider the "chapter headers" / delta-encoding technique. It's solid enough situation in this case.~~

    - ChapterEpochRecord/ChapterHeader:[Rs.Kind.ChapterHeader, time_stamp]

    - This can be done in the future...

        - ... YOU WILL **NOT** WANT TO WASTE YOUR LIFE ON SHIT LIKE THIS!

- use sqlite3 to STEAL from ~/wakatime.db

- a simple cmd that would be handy:
    - select for instance url in web-browser
    - hit kbd-cmd
    - copies selection, opens text-field in mini-win for tags, hit enter when done
    - store in appropriate event-log / data-place (=> sync to cloud)
