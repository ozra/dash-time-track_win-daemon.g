# IDEAS #

- when switching x-window, capture which, all data available
- if to little, find other ways of calling cmd's from programs to generate report to db
- vim can be plugged to do all kinds of analytics quickly upon load and save - filename naturally
   - can quickly reveal the insane amounts of time going in to _leasure meta_ (customization)
- _active_ time spend in apps is a good measure when possible
- every command issued in interactive terminal is logged
- _some_ parts of feed will be obfuscated (`pass: ...`)
   - filters can be added by time
   - they can be executed retroactively
- This will automatically shed a light on sleep cycles (last thing off/left to still, and first thing brought about is the 'puter)


## Technical details ##

- URL's when first caught are put in their own table, since one might switch to the same url many times (many events)
   - they are referenced via uuid from main event log.
- quate could be incorporated at a later stage (good reason to create a good import from sql)
   - idea being that heavy AI-analysis will be more efficient - provided that quate kicks as much ass as I've fooled myself into thinking (DB's aren't exactly new...)


# ADDITIONAL MACRO PARTS #

- "psychonaut" - command-line psychologist
   - what are you doing know? How are you feeling?
   - ...
   - How can you phrase that in a different way that is (even) more constructive?

- "thoughts" - journal, written from cmd-line for conciseness and availability
   - most reasonable way I'll ever get into the habit of keeping a captain's log
   - must be secured with crypto to ensure nothing is held back
   - naturally filtered out from system-history and general log (via command logging) - other than the event taking place, timing, etc.
   - would be cool if an AI could be trained on it, analyzing behavioral patterns
